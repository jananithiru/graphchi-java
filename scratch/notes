We need to be able to identify hyperedges. 

So we store two lists when we do preprocessing. 

One list contains vertices ids
the other list contains hyperedges ids




Create another type of input parameter similar to edjlist and then do the checks 

e.g .

myexamples/test2PageRank.dat 2 edgelist

myexamples/test2PageRank.dat 2 adjlist 

myexamples/test2PageRank.dat 2 hyperedges





hyperedges and verteices cant share the same id 

We need to explicitly understand that a hyperedge is a vertex 

Graphchi assumes missing vertices and sets them to 0. 




Synchronisation issues

Graphchi puts up dummy vertices etc etc
